# Fibrin gel bead assay single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq)
## Overview
The code here was used to process scRNA-Seq data from the fibrin gel bead assay used for studying <i>in vitro</i> sprouting angiogenesis.

In the experiment, primary human endothelial cells were seeded on carrier beads and embedded in a fibrin gel matrix. Human primary fibroblasts were seeded on top of the gel. After one week in culture, cells were isolated and processed using the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3' v3.1 kit. Transcript quantification was carried out with Cell Ranger version 6.1.2.
